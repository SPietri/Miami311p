Description: This is a repository for the R package Miami311p. 
             It gathers API data and stores it to a SQL database in the users working directory. 
             The data can be gathered daily and will be stored in the database under the label of 
             the date (without overwriting the previous days data). Since the API only includes recent 
             entries of size 1000, a dataset of Miami311 data going back to 2013 is also included by 
             the name Miami_Dade.
